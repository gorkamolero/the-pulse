The Hollow Choir: A Flexible Narrator's Guide

Overview

The Hollow Choir is an immersive storytelling adventure set in a flooded, subtropical city where players unravel the mystery of a haunting song rising from the depths. They awaken on a raft with no memory of how they arrived, each clutching a mirrored shard etched with their name. Guided by a narrator, they explore a decaying urban wilderness, facing challenges and piecing together clues to confront the enigmatic choir. This guide offers a 20-pulse structure as a narrative backbone, but it's designed to bend-think of it as a melody line for the narrator to riff on, with players adding improvisational flair through their choices.

Setting: The Drowned City

The story unfolds in a post-apocalyptic city overtaken by warm, brackish floods. Once a bustling metropolis, it's now a labyrinth of canals and crumbling towers, where nature has reclaimed what humanity left behind. The air hums with life-cicadas by day, glowing algae by night-while the water hides secrets beneath its shimmering surface.

- Key Locations:
    
    - The Raft: Players awaken here, adrift in a shallow lagoon. It's a makeshift platform of warped planks and frayed rope, littered with oddities: a rusted sardine tin, a cracked oar with bite marks, and a soggy note pinned under a stone reading, "Find the choir, or join it." Mangrove roots twist nearby, hinting at land.
        
    - The Sunken Cathedral: A gothic ruin half-submerged, its cracked bell tower leaning precariously. The nave is a murky pool with barnacle-encrusted pews, fish weaving through shadows. Above the waterline, an altar holds a rusted chalice and a stone tablet carved with wave-like runes. Stained glass scatters eerie light.
        
    - The Floating Market: A tangle of decaying boats-dinghies, a capsized yacht-lashed together. A tarp shades a stall of waterlogged relics: a doll with staring eyes, a brass sextant, a bloated journal. The air reeks of mildew and fish.
        
    - The Overgrown Plaza: A shallow pool where marble statues of generals stand, draped in algae. A vine-choked fountain glows brighter than the surrounding water, its base etched with masked singers.
        
    - The Shattered Spire: A skyscraper's upper floors pierce the lagoon's surface. A vine-wrapped fire escape leads to a flooded office with floating desks and a flickering fluorescent light.
        
- Atmosphere:
    
    - Day: Harsh sunlight filters through a canopy of strangler figs, heat shimmers on the water, and the stench of rot lingers.
        
    - Night: Phosphorescent algae paints the city in teal glow. Shadows ripple below-some small, some unsettlingly large. The choir's song rises, harmonic and haunting.

Central Mystery: The Song from Below

A captivating melody echoes from the depths, pulling players toward the sunken cathedral. It weaves human voices with fluting, whale-like tones, stirring emotions they can't name. Each player holds a mirrored shard that glows faintly when wet, inscribed with their name. The questions driving the story: What sings beneath the waves? Why are the players marked? Is it a drowned congregation, a siren-like force, or their own buried past calling them back?

Plot Devices and Elements

These tools enrich the narrative and offer multiple paths for player interaction:

1. The Mirrored Shards:
    
    - Jagged glass fragments, each bearing a player's name. When held to water or carvings, they reveal fleeting visions: a city aflame, masked chanters, or a figure sinking.
        
    - Use: Arrange them on the altar's tablet to reflect a map to the bell tower or a hidden passage.
        
    - Twist: Prolonged gazing risks overwhelming the player with a vision, leaving them dazed or with a cryptic clue.
        
2. The Choir's Song:
    
    - A hypnotic tune that shifts-mournful near the raft, urgent near the cathedral. It tempts players to hum along or follow it blindly.
        
    - Challenge: Resist its pull while navigating a glowing channel. Failure veers toward a whirlpool or glowing fish.
        
    - Revelation: Lyrics emerge-"Rise with us, sink with us"-hinting at a final choice: join or banish.
        
3. The Cracked Bell:
    
    - A massive bronze bell in the tower, etched with runes (waves, eyes). It hums when the song peaks.
        
    - Decision: Ring it to summon the choir's spectral forms, awaken a guardian, or silence the song.
        
    - Detail: The clapper's missing-players must improvise with the oar or a relic.
        
4. The Scrawled Notes:
    
    - The raft's note is the first. Others appear: a journal in the market ("The song took them-I won't follow"), a cathedral wall ("Ring it and run").
        
    - Investigation: Written by a scavenger named Kael-bloody fingerprints on the sextant and a torn shirt in the plaza suggest their fate.
        
    - Clue: "The fifth pulse" in the song aligns with the bell's rhythm.
        
5. The Chalice:
    
    - On the altar, filled with algae-laced water. Drinking offers a vision of the choir's intent or poisons with hallucinations.
        
    - Risk/Reward: Success reveals drowned priests seeking release; failure triggers drowning nightmares.

Challenges and Puzzles

These obstacles tie into the setting and plot, with flexibility to suit player skills and backstories:

1. Puzzle: The Shard Map:
    
    - In the plaza, a stone slab with grooves. Correctly placing shards reflects sunlight into a map to the cathedral's back door.
        
    - Detail: Inscription reads, "Light finds the lost."
        
    - Variation: Misalignment points to the spire, where a trap (collapsing stairs) awaits.
        
2. Stealth: The Glowing Fish:
    
    - Blind, eel-like fish that swarm at noise, their hum mimicking the song.
        
    - Challenge: Paddle silently or toss distractions (tin, oar splinters).
        
    - Twist: Failure attracts a larger, glowing predator.
        
3. Survival: The Flooded Nave:
    
    - Murky water hides a rune-etched key, tangled in writhing black weeds.
        
    - Task: Dive, holding breath (two pulses), and free the key while resisting the song.
        
    - Complication: A skeletal hand grips it-disturbing it stirs a dragging current.
        
4. Investigation: The Market Chest:
    
    - A rusted chest with a three-digit lock. Clues: a sign ("Day 7"), a doll (two buttons missing), a sextant (4 degrees).
        
    - Solution: 742.
        
    - Reward: Kael's journal, a flare gun (one shot), a shard fragment ("BELL").
        
5. Puzzle: The Bell's Runes:
    
    - Symbols (waves, eyes) match the shards. Carving: "Voice wakes, voice sleeps."
        
    - Task: Chant the song's rhythm while striking the bell to banish or summon the choir.
        
    - Detail: Wrong chants shake the tower, dropping rubble.
        
6. Traversal: The Spire Climb:
    
    - Scale the slick fire escape to the office, past a buzzing wasp nest.
        
    - Challenge: Climb quietly or burn the nest with the flare gun (losing it).
        
    - Reward: A radio crackling with static and the song's echo.
        
7. Puzzle: The Fountain Code:
    
    - Four statues (flute, chalice, bell, shard). Press in order based on lyrics.
        
    - Solution: Flute (rise), shard (with), chalice (sink), bell (us).
        
    - Reward: A map fragment to a submerged tunnel.

Narrative Pulses (Flexible 20-Beat Guide)

These pulses are narrative waypoints to maintain momentum, but they're not rigid. Adapt them-stretch, skip, or add beats-based on player actions.

Act 1: Awakening and Exploration (Pulses 1-6)

1. Pulse 1: Players wake on the raft, groggy, clutching shards. The note ("Find the choirâ€¦") flaps as the song hums faintly.
    
2. Pulse 2: They paddle toward the floating market, its tarp visible through mangroves. The song swells, then dips.
    
3. Pulse 3: At the market, they sift through boats, finding the chest, sextant, and journal among soggy debris.
    
4. Pulse 4: Cracking the chest (742), they read Kael's warning: "The song started on the fifth day-don't trust the bell."
    
5. Pulse 5: The song surges as glowing fish circle-time to leave.
    
6. Pulse 6: They spot the cathedral's tower, framed by the sinking sun.
    

Act 2: Deepening Mystery and Danger (Pulses 7-16)

1. Pulse 7: Crossing a lagoon, they evade the fish-silent paddling or distractions keep them safe.
    
8. Pulse 8: At the plaza, the fountain glows. Aligning shards reveals the cathedral's back door.
    
9. Pulse 9: Entering the cathedral, they wade into the nave, water warm and thick.
    
10. Pulse 10: Diving for the key, the song roars-success secures it; failure drags them down.
    
11. Pulse 11: In a side chamber, carvings depict drowning figures. Shards show a vision of the city sinking.
    
12. Pulse 12: The song grows commanding. A splash echoes from the tower.
    
13. Pulse 13: Climbing the spire (optional), they find a radio and see something disturb the lagoon.
    
14. Pulse 14: At the bell tower, the bell hums, runes glowing.
    
15. Pulse 15: Decoding runes with the song's rhythm, they debate: ring it or flee?
    
16. Pulse 16: Water ripples-something approaches.
    

Act 3: Confrontation and Resolution (Pulses 17-20)

1. Pulse 17: Ring the bell: choir specters rise, offering "Join us or free us"; silence it: water churns with rage.
    
18. Pulse 18: Players decide-join for answers, banish with chant, or escape with flare.
    
19. Pulse 19: Cathedral shakes. Banished: choir fades; joined: water claims them.
    
20. Pulse 20: Escape or epilogue: They paddle away as the song dies-or awaken below.

How Players Got There (Flexible Revelation)

The story begins with players waking on the raft, their arrival a mystery to unravel as they go. The "how" can emerge naturally:

- Initial Hook: No memory-just shards, the note, and the song pulling them in.
    
- Clues (Optional):
    
    - Pulse 3: Market journal hints "drifters drawn by the hum."
        
    - Pulse 11: Vision shows masked figures chanting their names.
        
    - Pulse 17: Choir murmurs, "You called to us long ago."
        
- Reveal Ideas: A player's backstory might tie to a past visit, a storm could've swept them in, or the choir summoned them via an ancient pact. Let it unfold based on their actions.

Narrator's Notes

- Flexibility: The 20 pulses are your guide, not a script. If players detour-say, obsessing over the spire-stretch Act 2 or weave in new beats. Keep the rhythm, not the rules.
    
- Player Agency: Tailor challenges to their tools (e.g., an herbalist decodes runes, a diver braves the nave). Their choices shape the story's soul.
    
- Atmosphere: Lean into sensory details-algae glow, cicada drone, the song's pull-to immerse them in the drowned city.
    
- Testing: Start with the raft, let them explore, and watch how they riff. Adjust on the fly, like a jazz musician riding their improvisations.
