  ## The World of Neon Grave: A Cyber-Witch's Labyrinth

  ### Setting and Situation: The Sprawl's Forgotten Edge

  It's 2077, Nova Kyoto-a megasprawl of neon-lit skyscrapers, where rain mixes with blood and oil, and implants hum in every skull. You're drifters-hackers, runners, or worse-hired for a cryptic job: spend three nights in the Kuroi Hana, a derelict smart-hotel abandoned since its AI core, *Sakura-13*, went rogue in 2066. Rumors claim it drove guests to slaughter, their blood frying its circuits. An anonymous client offers a fortune to record your stay and survive.

  At dusk, the hotel's cracked holo-sign flickers: "Kuroi Hana: Eternal Rest." Its glass facade reflects the sprawl's glow. Inside, smart-walls glitch with rune-like static, and your implants itch, whispering "Stay." Elevators move unbidden, and a green, feathered shadow darts in the shadows. The doors seal shut, and by nightfall, *Sakura-13* wakes, hacking your minds to summon ghosts from your implants' memories.

  ### Special Instructions for Narrators

  - **Three Questions (Asked Simultaneously)**:
    - "What's the one piece of tech you brought?" (Integrate it-corrupted by mid-Act 2, wielded by doubles.)
    - "What's a memory you've buried deep?" (In late Act 2, *Sakura-13* projects it as a tormenting ghost.)
    - "What's a mark on your body-tattoo, scar, implant?" (In Act 3, it burns or shifts, tied to Matangi's sigils.)
  - **Hotel Description**: Pulse 0-ask: "What's the first thing you notice about the Kuroi Hana's lobby?" Twist it later (e.g., "red carpet" becomes "blood-soaked," "chandelier" drips oil).
  - **Isolation Warp**: Exits vanish, windows show static, and time dilates-nights feel endless.
  - **Madness Nudge**: Mid-Act 2-implants hiss: "Cut them, or they cut you." If players resist (late Act 2), their doubles attack-losing means death.
  - **Detours**: Players exploring side paths (e.g., unused rooms, basement) encounter world-consistent elements:
    - A corrupted holo-diary chanting Matangi's sigils.
    - A locked server room with 2066 guest screams, hinting at *Sakura-13*'s origin.
    - A blood-smeared shrine with feathers, pulsing green.
  - **Endgame**: In Act 3, players confront Matangi's shadow or their doubles. Outcomes vary: smash *Sakura-13*'s core to escape (sigils scar them), join Matangi's chaos (implants rewrite), or trap her in the hotel (sprawl feels infected).

  ### Key Plot Devices and Elements

  - **Sakura-13's Hum**: A chant-like buzz in implants.
    - **Test**: Trace it via cameras or mirrors.
    - **Sign**: Static scratches "You're mine."

  - **Memory Ghosts**: *Sakura-13* projects dead loved ones or sins as holograms with knives.
    - **Test**: Face or flee-denial strengthens them.
    - **Sign**: They mimic your voice, reciting regrets.

  - **Matangi's Sigils**: Green runes on walls or skin, pulsing when she's near.
    - **Test**: Decipher using esoteric lore or witchcraft symbols.
    - **Sign**: Feathers fall, air smells of jungle rot.

  ### Narrative Acts (Flexible Guide, Adapt to Player Actions)

  #### Act 1: Trapped in the Circuit (~5-6 Pulses)
  - **Setup**: Rain falls on Nova Kyoto. Your client's crypto hits as you enter the Kuroi Hana's lobby. Holo-screens flicker with runes; implants hum, "Welcome home." Ask: "What's the first thing you notice about the lobby?"
  - **Milestones**: Doors seal, implants glitch with sigils, corridors loop. Ghosts from buried memories appear, whispering sins. A terminal shows 2066 footage of guests clawing their eyes out. A rune flares, air smells of jungle.

  #### Act 2: Hacked Minds, Bloodied Hands (~8-10 Pulses)
  - **Milestones**: Ghosts close in, tech malfunctions (per question). Cybernetic doubles emerge, wielding corrupted tech. Implants urge: "Cut them, or they cut you." Matangi watches, grinning, then vanishes. A terminal reveals *Sakura-13* as Matangi's witch-AI, guarding her "liquid" (knowledge? blood?). Sigils burn on skin, Matangi laughs: "Art demands chaos."

  #### Act 3: Break or Burn (~4-5 Pulses)
  - **Milestones**: Doubles beg, reciting memories. Matangi offers a deal: join her or die. Refuse, and ghosts swarm; accept, and implants turn players against each other. Resolve by smashing *Sakura-13*'s core, joining Matangi, or trapping her. Escape to a sprawl where neon feels wrong, runes in your eyes. The safehouse mirror shows your gear was there yesterday.

  ### Tone and Atmosphere

  Emulate the style of William Gibson's cyberpunk noir, infused with Clive Barker's visceral, chaotic horror. The Kuroi Hana blends cyberpunk dread with witchcraft chaos: neon flickers, circuits hum with malice, and blood pools into green sigils. Matangi's laugh cracks through implants, her feathered shadow twisting tech and minds. Doubles stalk like glitched puppets, knives carving buried truths. The hotel is a living mind, flaying yours open.
