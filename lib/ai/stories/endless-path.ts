## The World of The Endless Path: A Night Looped in Hell

### Setting and Situation: Navaluenga's Rain-Soaked Nightmare

It's February 29, 2025, and you're driving through Navaluenga's backroads-Castilla y León's wild pines where rain churns trails to mud. You're heading to your rented cabin, a worn stone shack deep in the forest, roof sagging under the storm. *Cuarto Milenio* hums on the radio-Iker Jiménez talking Taggart's Comet, passing tonight, tied to vanishings and suicides a century ago. Wet pine and rot fill the air, fog blanking the night. Then phones glitch, GPS spins wild, leading you off track. Lights flicker out, the engine dies-radio still hissing about loops and despair. Rain slams down, a faint glow cuts through the dark.

You slog through mud to the glow-the cabin. Door's open, light's on, but it's wrong-your stuff's already inside, doubled. Noises creep up outside-soft, then loud-a stone crashes through the glass. You bolt, hunted through the forest. Soon, you discover your pursuers are earlier versions of yourselves-knives out, relentless. You find temporary safety, resume walking, and discover another cabin with yet another set of yourselves who just arrived with a working car. Violence is inevitable - either kill these new doubles or they will try to kill you. Miles of forest loop back to the same scenarios. You hunt, blood spills-the sun rises, car works, you escape. Dead doubles litter the way home-river, road, trees-too many. Home feels wrong-decor off, families strange-relatives act as if you've already arrived. Your timeline's gone.

### Special Instructions for Narrators

- **This time the three questions are asked to both players at the same time**, ask:  
  - "What are you bringing to the cabin?" Use it-doubles have these around Pulse 5 (same bags, same food, same stuff).  
  - "Describe your home. Describe one detail there (sound, item, feel)?" Twist it in Pulse 19-20-things are different.  
- **Cabin Description**: Pulse 0-ask: "Describe this cabin you're going to. How do you remember it?" Adapt it when they find the cabin, things are off (e.g., "deer head in the entrance" vs. "bull head", one bed vs two. No bathroom, etc.).  
- **Night Warp**: It's always night and raining and fog trap. Sun breaks at Pulse 18-pace by flow.  
- **Hunt Nudge**: Pulse 15-radio hisses: "They've got your keys-end them." If they wait (post-Pulse 16), doubles attack-lose if they die.
- **Endgame**: Kill doubles (Pulse 17-18)-car starts, go home (Pulse 19-20)-wrong timeline dawns.

### Key Plot Devices and Elements

- **Comet Hum**: A hum rides the rain-low, gnawing at you.  
  - **Test**: Track it-listen where it cuts deepest.  
  - **Sign**: "You're lost" crackles close.

- **Earlier Selves**: Players will discover their pursuers are doubles of themselves, keys jangling, knives drawn.  
  - **Test**: Fight or hide to break out.  
  - **Sign**: Only revealed upon confrontation.

- **Later Selves**: They are unaware of anything, they just got there. All their stuff works.

### Narrative Pulses (Be flexible, this is a non-strict 20-Beat Guide, could be 26, but things must happen in this order. Make sure pulses prompt action / decision)

#### Act 1: Stranded in the Rain (1-6)
0. Rain beats the car-*Cuarto Milenio* hums about the comet passing tonight. explicitly paraphrase the following by Iker Jiménez from Cuarto Milenio (find a way for him to say the date and time ${Date.now().toLocaleString()}) saying: "Taggart's Comet returns tonight after 100 years. The last time it passed, dozens vanished across rural Spain—suicides, disappearances. Some claimed time itself bent around them." Make sure to maintain the eerie, documentary-style delivery that characterizes the show... But do not be too on the nose. The GPS glitches, spins you wrong-phones flicker, lights start to dim outside.
1. Car lights die, engine quits-radio stays on, whispering about loops and suicides related to the comet.  
4. You're stuck in the mud. Car won't start-a glow shines far off through the fog and rain.  
5. Cabin's door hangs open-light's on, your stuff's already inside, everything's doubled (players must discover this on exploration). Things are off about the cabin.  
6. Noises scratch outside-quiet at first, then a stone smashes the window hard. If you confront the attackers, you discover they are earlier versions of yourselves.

#### Act 2: Hunted and Looped (7-16)
7. You bolt-rains very hard, footsteps hunt you through the rain.  
8. Pines loom-earlier selves chase, blades catch the faint light ahead. Mud drags-you duck low or fight, hiding from the hum and their steps.  
9. Fog thins-lost them for now (or killed them), you find a moment to catch your breath.
10. You resume walking, and miles stretch-a light glows faint, another cabin's outline cuts the dark again.  
11. From not so far, you see yourselves arriving and getting in the cabin-your gear hums, car's alive with their keys, this version of you seem very happy.  
12. You must decide to confront these new doubles - violence is inevitable. Either you kill them or they will try to kill you.
13. If you hesitate, one turns-grins: "Time chose us"-knives gleam, kill or be killed.
14. They strike-if you wait, doubles lunge-lose if they cut you down.

#### Act 3: Break and Break Apart (17-20)
15. You swing-earlier selves bleed out, mud drinks the dust down slow.  
16. Sun breaks everything's beautiful, players will decide to go home
17. Car coughs alive-you split for home.  
18. On the way, eerie sights of dead doubles of the players line the way - one floating face-down in the river, arms outstretched; another impaled on a broken tree branch; one hanging from a pine tree by their own belt; yet another slumped against rocks with their throat cut.
19. Back home, loved ones seem off-decor's wrong, details are wrong.
20. Family members casually mention "you already came home hours ago" before continuing their normal routines, completely dismissing your confusion. Your stuff is there-timeline's not yours!

### Tone and Atmosphere

The rain gnawed Navaluenga's darkness with hungry teeth while the comet's hum stirred something ancient below. Your duplicates emerged from fog, knives steady as churchgoers' hands. The cabin didn't just wait—it watched, wooden bones settling in anticipation. Blood spilled; mud drank greedily. Time fractured. Meeting your own eyes across the room was like finding a stranger in your bathroom mirror at 3 AM. Horror crawled beneath your skin like insects, nesting where no light could reach.
